                    In this buzz of productivity, most of us forget to stop up and look at what is around us. 
                    Here, we suggest you to make a habit of talking  10-minute walks daily, to experience the relationship between people and places around you. 
                    For starters, we’ve known that walking helps improve oxygen flow to the brain. This may also positively impacts your mood and mental health.
